<a id="usage"></a>

## Usage

## Render Payment Modal
There are two types of modal that can be rendered, the inline modal and the standard modal. The inline modal is rendered on your website while the standard modal is rendered on a flutterwave hosted page.

### Inline Modal
```php
use Flutterwave\Payments\Facades\Flutterwave;
use Flutterwave\Payments\Data\Currency;

$payload = [
    "tx_ref" => Flutterwave::generateTransactionReference(),
    "amount" => 100,
    "currency" => Currency::NGN,
    "customer" => [
        "email" => "developers@flutterwavego.com"
    ],
];

$payment_details = Flutterwave::render('inline', $payload);

return view('flutterwave::modal', compact('payment_details'));

```

### Standard Modal
```php
use Flutterwave\Payments\Facades\Flutterwave;
use Flutterwave\Payments\Data\Currency;

$payload = [
    "tx_ref" => Flutterwave::generateTransactionReference(),
    "amount" => 100,
    "currency" => Currency::NGN,
    "customer" => [
        "email" => "developers@flutterwavego.com"
    ],
];

$payment_link = Flutterwave::render('standard', $payload);

return redirect($payment_link);
```

## Logging

To enable logging, simple add the following to your config file `config/logging.php`

```php
'flutterwave' => [
    'driver' => 'single',
    'path' => storage_path('logs/flutterwave.log'),
    'level' => 'debug',
],

```

## Webhook Setup

Create a Webhook url to receive payment notification on Payment events.
Below is a sample of a webhook url implementation using the new package.
```php
use Flutterwave\Payments\Facades\Flutterwave;
use Flutterwave\Payments\Data\Status;

Route::post('flutterwave/payment/webhook', function () {
    $method = request()->method();
    if ($method === 'POST') {
        //get the request body
        $body = request()->getContent();
        $webhook = Flutterwave::use('webhooks');
        $transaction = Flutterwave::use('transactions');
        //get the request signature
        $signature = request()->header($webhook::SECURE_HEADER);

        //verify the signature
        $isVerified = $webhook->verifySignature($body, $signature);

        if ($isVerified) {
            [ 'tx_ref' => $tx_ref, 'id' => $id ] = $webhook->getHook();
            [ 'status' => $status, 'data' => $transactionData ] = $transaction->verifyTransactionReference($tx_ref);

            $responseData = ['tx_ref' => $tx_ref, 'id' => $id];
            if ($status === 'success') {
                switch ($transactionData['status']) {
                    case Status::SUCCESSFUL:
                        // do something
                        //save to database
                        //send email
                        break;
                    case Status::PENDING:
                        // do something
                        //save to database
                        //send email
                        break;
                    case Status::FAILED:
                        // do something
                        //save to database
                        //send email
                        break;
                }
            }

            return response()->json(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Webhook verified by Flutterwave Laravel Package', 'data' => $responseData]);
        }

        return response()->json(['status' => 'error', 'message' => 'Access denied. Hash invalid'])->setStatusCode(401);
    }

    // return 404
    return abort(404);
})->name('flutterwave.webhook');
```

## Testing

All of the SDK's tests are written with PHP's ```phpunit``` module. The tests currently test:
```Modals```,
```Webhooks```,
```Transactions```,

They can be run like so:

```sh
phpunit
```

>**NOTE:** If the test fails for creating a subaccount, just change the ```account_number``` ```account_bank```  and ```businesss_email``` to something different

>**NOTE:** The test may fail for account validation - ``` Pending OTP validation``` depending on whether the service is down or not
